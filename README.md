<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->







## About The Project
This is a python-based template for a DayZ PBO Packer, designed to create a functional, non-obfuscated PBO with the essential components. While I personally advise against writing a complete packer in python, if you are skilled in python and have sufficient time, it is indeed feasible.
